# OpenCode plugin for Claude Code

> **Tribute**: This project is inspired by and pays homage to
> [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) by OpenAI.
> The plugin architecture, command structure, and design patterns are derived from
> the original codex-plugin-cc project, adapted to work with
> [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) instead of Codex.

Use OpenCode from inside Claude Code for code reviews or to delegate tasks.

This plugin is for Claude Code users who want an easy way to start using OpenCode from the workflow
they already have.

## What You Get

- `/opencode:review` for a normal read-only OpenCode review
- `/opencode:adversarial-review` for a steerable challenge review
- `/opencode:rescue`, `/opencode:status`, `/opencode:result`, and `/opencode:cancel` to delegate work and manage background jobs

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI, desktop app, or IDE extension)
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) installed (`npm i -g opencode-ai` or `brew install opencode`)
- A configured AI provider in OpenCode (Claude, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- Node.js 18.18 or later

## Install

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
! curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasict/opencode-plugin-cc/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then reload the plugin:

```
/reload-plugins
```

You should see:

```
Reloaded: 1 plugin · 7 skills · 6 agents · 3 hooks ...
```

Finally, verify your setup:

```
/opencode:setup
```

> **What the installer does**: Clones the repo to `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`,
> caches the plugin files, and registers it in Claude Code's plugin config.
> It tries SSH first and falls back to HTTPS automatically.

### Set up an AI Provider

If OpenCode is installed but no AI provider is configured, set one up:

```
! opencode providers login
```

To check your configured providers:

```
! opencode providers list
```

### Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall opencode@tasict-opencode-plugin-cc
/reload-plugins
```

## Command Mapping (codex-plugin-cc -> opencode-plugin-cc)

| codex-plugin-cc | opencode-plugin-cc | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/codex:review` | `/opencode:review` | Read-only code review |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | `/opencode:adversarial-review` | Adversarial challenge review |
| `/codex:rescue` | `/opencode:rescue` | Delegate tasks to external agent |
| `/codex:status` | `/opencode:status` | Show running/recent jobs |
| `/codex:result` | `/opencode:result` | Show finished job output |
| `/codex:cancel` | `/opencode:cancel` | Cancel active background job |
| `/codex:setup` | `/opencode:setup` | Check install/auth, toggle review gate |

## Slash Commands

- `/opencode:review` -- Normal OpenCode code review (read-only). Supports `--base <ref>`, `--wait`, `--background`.
- `/opencode:adversarial-review` -- Steerable review that challenges implementation and design decisions. Accepts custom focus text.
- `/opencode:rescue` -- Delegates a task to OpenCode via the `opencode:opencode-rescue` subagent. Supports `--model`, `--agent`, `--resume`, `--fresh`, `--background`.
- `/opencode:status` -- Shows running/recent OpenCode jobs for the current repo.
- `/opencode:result` -- Shows final output for a finished job, including OpenCode session ID for resuming.
- `/opencode:cancel` -- Cancels an active background OpenCode job.
- `/opencode:setup` -- Checks OpenCode install/auth, can enable/disable the review gate hook.

## Review Gate

When enabled via `/opencode:setup --enable-review-gate`, a Stop hook runs a targeted OpenCode review on Claude's response. If issues are found, the stop is blocked so Claude can address them first. Warning: can create long-running loops and drain usage limits.

## Job Auto-Heal

Long-running tasks spawned via `/opencode:task --background` occasionally get
stuck in `investigating` status even after the OpenCode session has finished
server-side — typically because `POST /session/:id/message` fails to close its
HTTP body, the task-worker is killed, or the companion's watcher misses the
terminal signal.

The companion now reconciles this automatically:

- `companion.mjs status` and `companion.mjs result` run a silent auto-heal
  pass before they read state, so they never report a false "running" state
  for a session that is actually complete.
- `companion.mjs heal` scans for stuck jobs and reconciles them in bulk. Pass
  `--dry-run` to preview, `--json` for machine-readable output, and `--all`
  to include jobs from other Claude sessions.

Each heal check queries `GET /session/:id/message?limit=1`. If the last
assistant message has `info.finish` set and `info.time.completed >= job.startedAt`,
the job is transitioned to `completed` and the message text is persisted to
the job data file. If the task-worker PID is dead and the session has been
silent for >60 s, the job is transitioned to `failed` with a clear reason.

If the OpenCode server is unreachable, auto-heal is a no-op — status/result
commands still work, they just can't move stuck jobs forward until the server
comes back.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Plugin not loading after install (0 plugins)</strong></summary>

1. Re-run the installer: `! curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasict/opencode-plugin-cc/main/install.sh | bash`
2. Run `/reload-plugins` again.
3. If still failing, restart Claude Code.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install script fails to clone</strong></summary>

The script tries SSH first, then HTTPS. If both fail:

- Check your network connection
- For SSH: ensure `ssh -T git@github.com` works
- For HTTPS: run `gh auth login` to set up credentials
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenCode commands not working</strong></summary>

1. Verify OpenCode is installed: `! opencode --version`
2. Verify a provider is configured: `! opencode providers list`
3. Run `/opencode:setup` to check the full status.
</details>

## Architecture

Unlike codex-plugin-cc which uses JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout, this plugin communicates with
OpenCode via its HTTP REST API + Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming. The server is automatically
started and managed by the companion scripts.

```
codex-plugin-cc                          opencode-plugin-cc
+----------------------+                 +------------------------+
| JSON-RPC over stdio  |                 | HTTP REST + SSE        |
| codex app-server     |      vs.        | opencode serve         |
| Broker multiplexing  |                 | Native HTTP (no broker)|
| codex CLI binary     |                 | opencode CLI binary    |
+----------------------+                 +------------------------+
```
